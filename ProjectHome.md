We propose to amend the code of the Linux kernel to implement three different replacement policies in virtual memory pages: ARC (Adaptive Replacement Cache, the random exchange and LFU (Least Frequently Used). Will also proposed a series of tests to evaluate the results obtained.

We use the 2.6.38-8-generic kernel on Ubuntu 11.04.
